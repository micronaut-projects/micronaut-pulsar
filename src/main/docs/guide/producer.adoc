== Creating producers

To initialize a producer it's sufficient to annotate an interface with `@PulsarProducerClient` and annotate methods with `@PulsarProducer`.

snippet::example.Producer[project-base="doc-examples/example", indent="0"]
<1> Annotate interface with @PulsarProducerClient to notify Micronaut for processing it without implementation
<2> Methods are the actual producers so annotate them with @PulsarProducer
<3> Return decides whether to send message in a blocking or non-blocking manner.
<4> A blocking send that waits until message is successfully sent or throws an exception on failure.

Producers can be used in other types of beans as well (Singleton or such).

=== Producer method

It's important to note that if the method contains more than 1 argument, `@MessageBody` must be specified on argument
intended for message body as well as `@MessageKey`, `@MessageProperties`, `@MessageHeader` depending on desired mapping.

WARNING: As with Consumers it's important to spot `@MessageProperties` for collection of headers value but `@MessageHeader`
for single header mapping on method argument. More details in consumer warning.

=== Producer return values

Not counting wrappers for async behaviour (CompletableFuture, RxJava, reactor cor), abstract methods can only have 2 return
types: void or MessageId since nothing more than sending will be done.

Non-abstract methods can have any return type except for `MessageId` in the sense that it will not be filled by Pulsars
resulting value. This is because return value must be defined within the method body so there is no reliable way to know
what was the intended return value - was it MessageID from the Pulsar or was it some other MessageID value generated
within the body.

Methods can be invoked before or after sending the message by setting the property `sendBefore` to `true` or `false` respectively.
Default is false which will execute method invoke message body before calling send message part.
In async approach behaviour is unpredicted as calling the method and sending the message has no blocking
thus message may still be sent before the execution of the method finishes or even starts properly because those can run
on separate threads. This is mainly useful for blocking approach where it's possible to execute the method body
before sending the message an if execution throws exception, sending will be skipped. *First parameter of the method is
still used as a message body*.

<1> For Kotlin, open is required in non-interface (abstract) classes because of AOT
<2> -
<3> -
<4> -
<5> Annotating method as a producer
<6> A non-abstract async method. In Kotlin case we need open to allow Micronaut AOT interception.
<7> CompletableFuture or suspend will trigger immediate execution but reactor or RxJava need subscription and will rely
on caller or upper layers to provide it.

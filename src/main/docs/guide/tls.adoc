== Transport encryption
To use transport encryption you must configure proper connection string as well as provide necessary information about
certificate path, ciphers, and protocols as shown in example below.

[configuration]
----
pulsar:
    service-url: 'pulsar+ssl://localhost:6651'
    tls-cert-file-path: 'path/to/cert.pem'
    tls-ciphers:
        - TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
        - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
    tls-protocols:
        - TLSv1.3
        - TLSv1.2
----

It's necessary to ensure that both server and client certificates match with supported ciphers and protocols. By default
hostname is not verified but can be enabled by using `tls-verify-hostname: true`

TLS as authentication method is not yet supported.
